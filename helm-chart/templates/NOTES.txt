CloudNativePostGres is used in db-deployment. As a result you need to install it.
Either with
```sh
helm install cloudnative-pg \
  cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg \
  --namespace cnpg-system \
  --create-namespace
```
or

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/release-1.28/releases/cnpg-1.28.0.yaml
```

ClusterIssuer is global, as a result it is disabled by default.
Maybe you already have a ClusterIssuer. In case not, just edit the values.yaml file, to enable it.

This also needs to be installed, either with helm
```sh
helm install \
  cert-manager oci://quay.io/jetstack/charts/cert-manager \
  --version v1.19.2 \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set crds.enabled=true
  ```

  or with Kubernetes
  
  ```sh
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.15.0/cert-manager.yaml
  ```
