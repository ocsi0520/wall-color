Project initialization
----------------------
As described in the [Geting started](../README.md#getting-started) section, initializing the project requires a single step: run `project-init.sh` in a POSIX-compliant terminal.

The script is a plain [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) and intentionally avoids Bash-specific features, so it can be executed safely on macOS and other POSIX-compatible systems.

Running the application requires completing the following three initialization steps, all of which are handled by `project-init.sh`.

Environment variables
----------------------
By default, both [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/variable-interpolation#env-file) and Podman Compose load environment variables from a `.env` file located next to the [base compose file](./local-dev.md).

If a `.env` file does not exist (for example, if `env-example.txt` was not copied manually), `env-init.sh` creates it automatically. Existing `.env` files are left untouched.

JWT for the backend
-------------------
The backend uses [JWT](https://www.jwt.io/introduction#what-is-json-web-token) for [authentication and authorization](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/authentication-vs-authorization/).

Specifically, it relies on a [JWS](https://dev.to/mayank_tamrkar/jwt-vs-jws-vs-jwe-whats-the-difference-when-to-use-each-16l2) with [asymmetric keys](https://www.softoneconsultancy.com/complete-guide-to-jwt-authentication-with-asymmetric-keys/). As a result, a public/private key pair must be generated. This is handled by `jwt-cert-init.sh`, which places the generated keys into _color-manager/src/main/resources/certs_.

Spring Boot loads these keys from the classpath at startup.

> **Note:** This approach is considered temporary and should be replaced. A tracking issue already exists: [#51](https://github.com/ocsi0520/wall-color/issues/51).

HTTPS for the reverse proxy
---------------------------
The reverse proxy requires a TLS certificate. For local development, a self-signed certificate is generated by `cert-init.sh` and stored in _reverse-proxy/deployment/certs_.

The certificate generation logic is based on the example from [Let’s Encrypt’s documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/#making-and-trusting-your-own-certificates), with one modification: since standard POSIX shell does not support [process substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html), a temporary configuration file is created instead.
